C#

Download VisualStudio 2022

There are two projects : 
+ Interface2App - which includes an graphical interface that define the information of flickers 
+ VisualSimuli - which implement the main program


HOW DOES IT WORKS ?

+ First you run project Interface2App (in bar Startup Project) 
Attention: Because of this program will create a file in Desktop so you must look at line 25 file GraphicalInterface.cs to change filePath to your suitable folder.
Ex: C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\Desktop\\test_file.txt ==> C:\\Users\\Asus(name of your computer)\\Desktop\\test_file.txt

You do the same thing at line 111 in file Cplay.cs 

+ Finally, change Startup project to VisualSimuli and run program.

All files are coded in C# and runing in VisualStudio
